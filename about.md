[Maptime](http://maptime.io) is, rather literally, time for mapmaking. Our mission is to open the doors of cartographic possibility to anyone interested by creating a time and space for collaborative learning, exploration, and map creation using mapping tools and technologies.

Although Maptime got its start in San Francisco, chapters have sprouted up all over the world, and now, in Sacramento. Come join us for Maptime Sacramento's inaugural hack night!

Beginners, you are especially welcome. We're here for you.
